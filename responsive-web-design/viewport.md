# Viewport

Viewport is the web page's **area visible to the user**.

The `viewport` meta can control the **size and the zoom level** of the view.

```markup
<meta name="viewport" content="...">
```

To **enable responsive features**, we set the `viewport`'s width to the width of the screen.  
Initial zoom level should be set to 1.

```markup
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
