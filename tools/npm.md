# NPM

**NPM** _**\(Node Package Manager\)**_  is the official Node.js package manager.

It is automatically installed with Node.js and is used to handle JavaScript _\(browser & Node.js\)_ dependencies.

> For those who knew [bower](https://bower.io/), well, it's dead.

NPM allows:

* Dependencies management _\(just like apt, gem, maven, nugget, pip, yum...\)._
* JavaScript modules creation and publishing.
* Download and install of dependencies depending on a module's dependencies description.
* Sharing entry point scripts with developers and machines _\(e.g.: Continuous Integration\)_ like `build`, `debug`, `deploy`, `test` etc...

We will use NPM once, to install [Yarn](yarn.md)...

... because it's better _\(Cf._ [_Yarn_](yarn.md)_\)_.
