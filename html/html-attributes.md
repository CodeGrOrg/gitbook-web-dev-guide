# HTML Attributes

As you can notice with `a` and `img` tags, some tags **can** _**\(or must\)**_ **be customized** using HTML attributes.

**Attributes are for HTML tags what parameters are for functions**.

{% hint style="success" %}
Some tags might need multiple attributes especially when combined with frameworks like Angular.

To avoid duplicates and to improve readability, attributes should be used in **alphabetical order** and on a **new line for each attribute**.
{% endhint %}
